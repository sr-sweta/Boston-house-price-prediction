# Boston house price prediction

This is a hackathon project. My team is working on it. This project is based on ML and web development. Ml model will take the details of the house and land and wil provide you its price. Along with this all search that will be done through our site will be stored in the backend which will be totally built using SQL server. All search history in this site we can conclude what kind of land and house mostly people are willing to sell and even the quality of land can be also be concluded. We are also thinking of taking details of certain user who even want to purchase land of certain kind and whose price have been predicted using our model. If both seller and buyer give their contacts to us by registering in our site can help us to mail the buyer and seller both if they want to buy or sell the land.
